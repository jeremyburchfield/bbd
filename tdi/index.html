                            <p>
                                The Council for Adult Experiential Learning (CAEL), a national organization, has been a leader for 39 years in connecting learning and work for adults. CAEL’s focus is to help solve the mounting national problem of increasing the number of post-secondary credentials among adults.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                CAEL research shows that adults who complete a Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) and earn college credit are 2 1/2 times more likely to persist to graduation. 43% of adults who complete the PLA earned a bachelor’s degree, compared to 15% of adults who did not complete PLA.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Without PLA, 6% completed the associate’s degree while 13% of those who completed PLA completed the associate’s degree.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In other words, 56% of adults who complete PLA completed at least a post-secondary degree while 21% of adults not completing PLA achieved at least a post secondary degree.

                            <p><b>RELEVANT RESEARCH:</b> CRTDI provides research and related commentary  regarding the following: College Completion: Firm Level Productivity, College Completion: Fiscal and Societal Impact, A Perspective on Degree Completion, Job Developing and Responsibilities, Pathways and Chattanooga Region Talent Dividend, Power Point Presentations and College Credit for Prior Learning (video). CRTDI is an active member of the National Adult College Completion Network. </p>
                            <p><b>ROUNDTABLES:</b>“Roundtables” are another critical component Of CRTDI. A descriptive guide includes: Introductions (sets context), Steps To Action, Discussion Questions and Hart Research Associates document regarding perceived preparation of students versus employers.</p>
                            <p><b>GEOSPATIAL MAPPING:</b> CRTDI applies Geospatial Mapping relevant to degree completion population for the entire region and “drills down” to the election districts including investment growth ($) in each county and city, due to degree completion.</p>
                            <p><b>GDP and WAGES:</b> CRTDI provides customized data analysis regarding GDP and Wage projections for 3 year cycles through 2025.The customized data analysis was made possible by the Milken Institute as an extension of the report “A Matter of Degrees”- CRTDI acknowledges appreciation of the Milken Institutes Ross Devol, chief research officer, and Nan Zhang, senior research analyst.</p>
                            <p><b>CREDIT for PRIOR LEARNING:</b> CRTDI has facilitated the development and production of a “video” about “Credit for Prior Learning (CPL).” This has involved the collaboration of higher education institutions and the Chattanooga Electric Power Board (EPB) that provided “in-kind services” of technical support personnel for technical assistance and production. CPL saves “time and “money” of employees and employers working toward degree completion. The affirmation of being a valued employee because of what they know, can do and will do is powerful. Powerful since education is considered continuous, stemming from work responsibilities, development and performance, as well as relevant higher education courses.</p>
                            <p><b>TALENT DIVIDEND AMBASSADORS and MARKETING the "BRAND":</b> Ambassadors for Talent (AFT) is a planned marketing program to engage “community volunteers” that:</p>
                            <ol style="text-align: left">
                                <li>Foster and promote links with the public, businesses and education institutions (K-22)</li>
                                <li>Promote and encourage ongoing education of citizens in the region (better education, better business, better jobs, better economy and better quality of life) – marketing the “brand” (“Talent Changes Everything”).
                                    Higher education institutions must offer degree programs that support current and future businesses and industries. And in order to keep college graduates local – as well as attract and retain a sustainable quality workforce – a given region must provide an attractive and distinctive job market, including the recruiting of an appropriate mix of employment opportunities. As the demise of a once robust city such as Detroit demonstrates, focusing only on immediate employment needs may sacrifice long term prospects. (Devol, Shen, Bedroussiam, Zhang, 2013, A Matter of Degree: The Effect of Educational Attainment on Regional Economic Prosperity. Washington, D. C.: Milken Institute).

                            </ol>
                            <p>The CRTDI”s goal is to increase by 60% post-secondary graduates in the region by 2025 (Regional goals are reset every 3 years). The Lumina Foundation goal is 60% of the nation’s adults by 2025. The  first step in reaching these goals is to remain committed to them. Together, higher education, working with business and industry can make this possible. The CRTDI in a facilitating role is causing this happen and, consequently, talent heretofore untapped will develop cotinuously.</p>
                                
                            <p>Our communities and our nation will be strengthened by a sustainable quality workforce – the brand being “Talent Changes Everything"&trade;.</p>

            <p class="em"><em>The Case for Business/Industry, and Chambers of Commerce in the Region Regarding Education</em></p>
            <p>
                Chattanooga 2.0 and "The Unfinished Agenda" have sparked renewed interest in education throughout the tristate 16 county region. One such front focuses on returning adults who have some college but no degree in order to strengthen the workforce and grow the economy. The Lumina Foundation has brought this initiative to the national level with the goal of 60% of the nation's citizens having completed a postsecondary education (certificates, associates degrees, bachelor degrees and beyond) by 2025. The Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce claims a mission to "champion our members business and promote economic growth." Businesses have a civic responsibility and a vested interest to demonstrate the value of education not only for an improved workforce, competitiveness, and profitability, but for the community/region at large. Business and industry have been treated as recipients of graduates from "top down" approaches, not so much as engaged partners. The engagement of business/industry and higher education requires direct two-way communications. Superficial personnel evaluation, peer review processes (accreditation), peer institution comparisons, insular institutional processes reporting, attention to bureaucratic rules instead of goals, objectives and results are insufficient measures of higher education.

<h3>Roundtables Information</h3>
<p>

</a>
<div id="round" class="collapse">
<div class="col-sm-12">
<p>
    It is anticipating the aforementioned skills and competencies will be embedded in course syllabi. Furthermore, assessment methods are applied to confirm proficiency of the students relative to skills and competencies achieved.

                        <b>Here’s one way:</b>
                        <p>The Chattanooga Region Talent Dividend Initiative (CRTDI) and nonprofit through the Greater Chattanooga Community Foundation aims to increase the number of working adult with college degrees. By 2025 we aim to see a regional increase up to 60% college or other post-secondary credential rate.</p>
                        <b>How it works:</b>
                        <p>Employees meet with one of the participating colleges in the 16 county region to identify the degree they want to pursue.</p>
                        <b>What you can do:</b>
                        <p>Employee and Employer should make sure the higher education institution has a policy relative to credit for Prior Learning. </p><br>
